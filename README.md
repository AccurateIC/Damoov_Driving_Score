# Damoov Driving Score

## Overview
This repository implements driving score calculation and analytics using Python. The project is organized for easy extension, integration of new features, and supports containerized development with Docker.

## Branch: `features/integration`
This branch contains work-in-progress features and multi-component integrations that are not yet merged into the main branch. It is intended for development and collaboration before finalizing changes.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AccurateIC/Damoov_Driving_Score.git
cd Damoov_Driving_Score
```

### 2. Switch to the integration branch
```bash
git checkout features/integration
```

### 3. Run with Docker (Recommended)
This project includes a `Dockerfile` for easy setup and reproducibility.

#### Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t damoov-driving-score .
```

#### Run the container:
```bash
docker run -it --rm damoov-driving-score
```

**Note:** You may want to mount volumes or set environment variables as required for development or data input.

### 4. Local Python Setup (Alternative)
If you prefer not to use Docker:

- Create a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
